```

## Data Selection Process

Here we select users who completed CES-D survey, with demographic information and fb status updates. There are `r dim(dep)[1]` participants completed CES-D, these users posted `r dim(dep_status)[1]` status updates from Jan 2009 - Nov 2011. 

```{r data, include=FALSE}
path = "/Users/lucia/phd_work/cognitive_distortion/data/"
setwd(path)
dep <- read.csv('dep.csv')
dep_status <- read.csv('user_status_match_dep.csv')
```

X users also have demographic info

```{r}

```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
